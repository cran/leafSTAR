#' Leaf angles of tropical canopy trees measured with traditional instrumentation
#'
#' The tropical data frame has 41 rows and 4 columns
#' @format This data frame contains the following columns:
#'
#' 		\strong{species} A code for each species (letters) and individuals (numbers) 
#'
#' 		\strong{environment}  Factor with three levels of exposure to solar radiation.
#'
#' 		\strong{pitch} Pitch angle in degrees.
#'
#' 		\strong{roll} Roll angle in degrees.
#'
#' @details These data are a subset of leaf angle data in Posada et al. (2009) measured with a compass and a protractor. Contains measurements of two leaf position angles of 41 leaves in two individuals of (\emph{Castilla elastica}) and one of (\emph{Ficus insipida}), each leaf in a row. The format of the data is an example of a field-data table handled by \code{'leafSTAR'}.
